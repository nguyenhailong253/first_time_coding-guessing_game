# first_time_coding-guessing_game
My first time getting exposed to coding. I followed a tutorial and made this game

# How it works

it will generate a random number. Your job is to guess it. it will return bigger, smaller, or exact (compared to chosen number) as you guess.
I have updated the game with 2 modes: 1 player and 2 player, and 3 difficulties level.
